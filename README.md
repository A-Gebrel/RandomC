Basically, where I make projects for fun and throw them to never see the light of day again.
Who knows, Maybe one day I'm going to need one of those in a project :shrug:

P.S: I'm aware that some part(s) of my code can be improved, most of the time I'm doing this for fun :)

## Contributing
I highly doubt anyone would waste his time on most of my scripts but I usually do my best to keep everything as clean and efficient as possible.

I always welcome any constructive criticism though, don't be shy :)
